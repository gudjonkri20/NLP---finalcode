      "<s>Hver er hæsta byggingin í Berlín?</s></s>Flestar þekktar byggingar Berlínar eru í borgarhlutanum Mitte, enda var hann miðborg Berlínar fyrir skiptingu, en einnig miðborg Austur-Berlínar fyrir sameiningu. Þekktasta bygging borgarinnar er Brandenborgarhliðið. Það er jafnframt orðið að þjóðartákni Þjóðverja eftir fall Berlínarmúrsins. Múrinn var aðeins í nokkra metra fjarlægð frá hliðinu, sem stóð austan við múrinn, þannig að það myndaði nokkurs konar botnlanga í miðborg Austur-Berlínar. Skammt norður af hliðinu stendur hið fræga ríkisþinghús ( \" Reichstag \" ). Það var reist sem þinghús á keisaratíma Prússlands og þar var Weimar-lýðveldið stofnað. Þegar bruninn í húsinu átti sér stað 1933, notaði Hitler sér hann sem átyllu til að auka völd sín og mynda þriðja ríkið. Þinghús þetta er næstvinsælasti ferðamannastaður Þýskalands, á eftir dómkirkjunni í Köln. Við Friedrichstrasse stóð varðstöðin Checkpoint Charlie. Hún var landamærastöð milli bandaríska og sovéska hernámssvæðanna á tíma kalda stríðsins. Safnaeyjan Museumsinsel er eyja í ánni Spree í miðborginni. Þar eru fjöldi safnhúsa, svo sem Pergamonsafnið ( \" Pergamonmuseum \" ), Bodesafnið ( \" Bodemuseum \" ), Altes Museum og Alte Nationalgalerie. Einnig er á eyjunni dómkirkjan í Berlín ( Berliner Dom ) og gamla þinghús Austur-Þýskalands ( \" Palast der Republik \" ), sem var rifið 2008. Gendarmenmarkt er stórt bílalaust torg rétt sunnan við breiðgötuna Unter den Linden. Það er af mörgum talið fegursta torg borgarinnar. Þar eru franska dómkirkjan ( \" Französischer Dom \" ), þýska dómkirkjan ( \" Deutscher Dom</s>\n",

Alexanderplatz er stórt og mikið umferðartorg í austurhluta borgarinnar. Þar stendur sjónvarpsturninn en hann er hæsta bygging borgarinnar. Þar nálægt er einnig rauða ráðhúsið ( \" Rotes Rathaus \" ), sem var ráðhús Austur-Berlínar meðan borgin var skipt. Það þjónar enn sem aðalráðhús borgarinnar. Aðra markverða staði og byggingar í Austur-Berlín má nefna Nicolai-hverfið, bænahús gyðinga ( Neue Synagoge ), stríðsminnisvarðann Neue Wache og leifar Berlínarmúrsins við aðaljárnbrautarstöðina.</s>\n"
